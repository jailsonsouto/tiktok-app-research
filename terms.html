    <h1>Terms of Service - Research-Tool-DSA</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 02, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Project Description</h2>
    <p>
        The "Research-Tool-DSA" is a non-commercial academic application developed as part of a Postgraduate
        MBA in Data Science and Analytics. The tool is designed to facilitate Netnography and Sentiment
        Analysis (ABSA/ASTE) within the cosmetics industry for academic and statistical purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
        This application is a private research tool. Access is restricted to the lead researcher and academic
        supervisors associated with the MBA program. It is not intended for public or commercial distribution.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Processing & TikTok API</h2>
    <p>
        We utilize the TikTok for Developers API to access public content and strictly comply with TikTok’s
        Developer Terms and applicable policies as described on
        <a href="https://developers.tiktok.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            TikTok for Developers
        </a>.
        This tool does not "scrape" data; it requests it through official channels for scientific analysis of
        consumer behavior and Natural Language Processing (NLP) modeling.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Ethical Guidelines & Data Usage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Data is used exclusively for the MBA thesis/capstone project.</li>
        <li>No personal data is used to identify individuals.</li>
        <li>Results are presented only in aggregate form (charts, trends, sentiment scores).</li>
        <li>Commercial exploitation of the collected data is strictly prohibited.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
        This software is provided "as is" for academic validation. We are not responsible for changes in
        third‑party API availability or data structure.
    </p>
